# DA2-Coding1-Final-Term-Project

The goal of this document is to investigate if a correlation exists between interactions
on a Facebook post and its reach and also to explore if other factors have an impact. Working in the marketing sector provided me with the opportunity to explore various digital media tools and their mechanics. The idea of how significant each components involved in the success of a social media post has always intrigued me. Therefore, Inspired by the research **_[S. Moro, P. Rita and B. Vala.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296316000813?via%3Dihub)_** (please click for link), I decided to use the same raw data to run an analysis of my own.
